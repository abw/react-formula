# react-formula

This is yet another React library for rendering forms.

It started life in 2018 not long after React version 16.3 was released
with its shiny new context API.  I wasn't too happy with the state of the
art in React forms up until then so I thought I'd have my own crack at it.

It then became part of [badger-ui](https://github.com/abw/badger-ui) where
it has lived happily for several years, foraging in the forest for nuts and
berries.

Now I'm looking to extract it out into a separate library.

Watch this space.
